# Agentic AI: Complete Guide for Engineers

## What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that can autonomously pursue goals, make decisions, and take actions with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional LLM interactions (single prompt → single response), agents can:

- Break down complex tasks into steps
- Use tools and execute functions
- Make decisions based on observations
- Iterate until goals are achieved
- Adapt strategies when encountering obstacles

**Think of it as:** Moving from a Q&A bot to a digital assistant that can actually get things done.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agent Anatomy

Every AI agent has these components:

**Brain (LLM Core)**
- The reasoning engine that decides what to do next
- Processes observations and plans actions

**Memory**
- **Short-term**: Current task context and recent history
- **Long-term**: Learned patterns, user preferences, past solutions

**Tools/Actions**
- Functions the agent can call (APIs, databases, calculators)
- Code execution capabilities
- File system access
- Web browsing

**Perception**
- How the agent observes its environment
- Feedback from tool executions
- Error messages and states

**Planning**
- Goal decomposition
- Strategy formulation
- Task prioritization

---

## Agent Architectures

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

The most popular and proven pattern.

**Flow:**
1. **Thought**: Agent reasons about what to do
2. **Action**: Agent executes a tool/function
3. **Observation**: Agent sees the result
4. Repeat until goal achieved

**Example:**
```
User: "What's the weather in the capital of France?"

Thought: I need to find the capital of France first
Action: search("capital of France")
Observation: Paris is the capital of France

Thought: Now I need the weather in Paris
Action: get_weather("Paris")
Observation: Temperature: 18°C, Cloudy

Thought: I have the answer
Final Answer: It's 18°C and cloudy in Paris
```

**Strengths:**
- Transparent reasoning
- Easy to debug
- Works well for most tasks

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be verbose
- May overthink simple tasks

---

### Function Calling / Tool Use

Modern approach where LLMs natively support structured function calls.

**How it works:**
1. Define available functions with JSON schemas
2. LLM decides which function to call
3. Your code executes the function
4. Return results to LLM
5. LLM continues or provides final answer

**Example structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get current weather for a location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "City name"
      }
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  }
}
```

**Strengths:**
- Structured and reliable
- Supported by major APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Less verbose than ReAct

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires careful function design
- May need multiple rounds for complex tasks

---

### Planning Agents

Agents that create complete plans before execution.

**Patterns:**

**Plan-and-Execute:**
1. Generate complete plan upfront
2. Execute each step
3. Adjust plan if steps fail

**Hierarchical Planning:**
1. Break goal into high-level subtasks
2. Each subtask becomes its own mini-agent
3. Combine results

**Strengths:**
- Efficient for complex, multi-step tasks
- Can parallelize independent steps
- Better resource estimation

**Weaknesses:**
- Rigid when plans need adjustment
- Upfront planning can be expensive

---

### Reflexion / Self-Correcting Agents

Agents that learn from mistakes and iterate.

**Flow:**
1. Attempt task
2. Evaluate result
3. Reflect on what went wrong
4. Generate improved strategy
5. Retry with new approach

**Use cases:**
- Code generation (write, test, fix, repeat)
- Research tasks (search, evaluate quality, refine query)
- Complex problem-solving

**Strengths:**
- Higher success rates
- Learns within a session
- Better quality outputs

**Weaknesses:**
- More API calls = higher cost
- Can get stuck in loops
- Needs good stopping criteria

---

## Multi-Agent Systems

Multiple specialized agents working together.

### Patterns

**Sequential Pipeline:**
```
Agent 1 (Researcher) → Agent 2 (Analyzer) → Agent 3 (Writer)
```

**Parallel Workers:**
```
Manager Agent
    ↓
[Worker 1] [Worker 2] [Worker 3]
    ↓           ↓           ↓
        Aggregator Agent
```

**Debate/Consensus:**
```
Agent A (proposes) ← → Agent B (critiques)
             ↓
       Agent C (judges)
```

### When to use multi-agent:
- Tasks naturally divide into specialized roles
- Need diverse perspectives
- Want parallel execution
- Complex workflows with dependencies

### Frameworks:
- **AutoGen** (Microsoft): Conversational agents
- **CrewAI**: Role-based agent teams
- **LangGraph**: Graph-based workflows
- **Custom**: Build your own orchestration

## Critical Implementation Patterns

### 1. The Agent Loop

```python
def agent_loop(task, max_iterations=10):
    context = initialize_context(task)
    
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        # Think
        decision = llm.decide_next_action(context)
        
        # Stopping condition
        if decision.is_complete:
            return decision.final_answer
        
        # Act
        result = execute_action(decision.action)
        
        # Observe
        context.add_observation(result)
        
        # Safety check
        if is_stuck(context) or is_unsafe(decision):
            return handle_failure(context)
    
    return "Max iterations reached"
```

### 2. Tool Definition

**Good tool design:**
```python
def search_database(
    query: str,
    filters: dict = None,
    limit: int = 10
) -> list:
    """
    Search the product database.
    
    Args:
        query: Search terms
        filters: Optional filters like {"category": "electronics"}
        limit: Maximum results to return
    
    Returns:
        List of matching products
    """
    # Implementation
```

**Key principles:**
- Clear descriptions
- Type hints
- Sensible defaults
- Error handling
- Return structured data

### 3. Memory Management

**Short-term (conversation) memory:**
```python
class ConversationMemory:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=4000):
        self.messages = []
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
    
    def add(self, message):
        self.messages.append(message)
        self._truncate_if_needed()
    
    def _truncate_if_needed(self):
        # Keep recent messages within token limit
        # Or summarize old messages
```

**Long-term memory:**
- Vector database for semantic search
- Traditional database for structured facts
- File system for documents

### 4. Safety & Control

**Critical safeguards:**

```python
# Maximum budget
MAX_API_CALLS = 20
MAX_COST = 1.00  # dollars

# Allowed actions
SAFE_ACTIONS = ["search", "read_file", "calculate"]
REQUIRES_APPROVAL = ["send_email", "make_purchase", "delete_file"]
FORBIDDEN = ["execute_code", "system_command"]

# Validation
def validate_action(action):
    if action in FORBIDDEN:
        raise SecurityError("Action not allowed")
    if action in REQUIRES_APPROVAL:
        return request_human_approval(action)
    return action in SAFE_ACTIONS
```

    result = search_tool("Python tutorials")
    assert len(result) > 0
    assert "Python" in result[0]["title"]
```

**Integration tests for agents:**
```python
def test_research_agent():
    agent = ResearchAgent()
    result = agent.run("What is quantum computing?")
    assert "quantum" in result.lower()
    assert len(result) > 100  # Substantial answer
```

**Evaluation metrics:**
- **Success rate**: % of tasks completed correctly
- **Efficiency**: Number of steps/API calls used
- **Cost**: Total API spend per task
- **Quality**: Human evaluation of outputs
- **Safety**: No forbidden actions taken

**LLM-as-judge:**
```python
def evaluate_agent_output(task, output):
    eval_prompt = f"""
    Task: {task}
    Agent Output: {output}
    
    Rate the output on:
    1. Correctness (1-5)
    2. Completeness (1-5)
    3. Efficiency (1-5)
    
    Provide scores as JSON.
    """
    return llm.evaluate(eval_prompt)
```

## Production Best Practices

### 1. Observability
```python
# Log everything
logger.info(f"Agent thought: {thought}")
logger.info(f"Tool called: {tool_name}")
logger.info(f"Result: {result}")

# Track metrics
metrics.track("agent.iterations", iteration_count)
metrics.track("agent.cost", total_cost)
metrics.track("agent.success", success)
```

### 2. Graceful Degradation
```python
try:
    result = autonomous_agent.run(task)
except MaxIterationsError:
    # Fall back to simpler approach
    result = simple_agent.run(task)
except BudgetExceededError:
    # Return partial result
    result = agent.get_best_effort_result()
```

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop
```python
if action.requires_approval():
    approval = await request_human_approval(
        action=action,
        reasoning=agent.reasoning,
        timeout=300  # 5 minutes
    )
    if not approval:
        agent.handle_rejection()
```

### 4. Versioning & Rollbacks
- Version control prompts and tool definitions
- A/B test agent changes
- Monitor success rates
- Quick rollback capability

### 5. Rate Limiting & Quotas
```python
class AgentRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_calls_per_minute=10):
        self.max_calls = max_calls_per_minute
        self.calls = []
    
    def check_limit(self):
        now = time.time()
        self.calls = [t for t in self.calls if now - t < 60]
        if len(self.calls) >= self.max_calls:
            raise RateLimitError()
        self.calls.append(now)
```
