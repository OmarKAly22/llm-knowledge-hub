# LLM Era: Essential Guide for Software Engineers

## Core Pillars

### 1. Prompt Engineering
**What it is:** The art and science of communicating effectively with LLMs to get desired outputs.

**Critical concepts:**
- **System prompts**: Set the AI's role and behavior
- **Few-shot learning**: Provide examples to guide output format
- **Chain-of-thought**: Ask the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step
- **Temperature & parameters**: Control randomness and output diversity
- **Prompt templates**: Reusable patterns for common tasks

**Best practices:**
- Be specific and clear about what you want
- Provide context and constraints
- Use delimiters to separate instructions from content
- Iterate and refine based on outputs
- Test with edge cases

---

### 2. AI Integration Architecture
**What it is:** Building reliable systems that incorporate LLMs as components.

**Critical concepts:**
- **API integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models
- **Error handling**: Timeouts, rate limits, content filtering
- **Fallback strategies**: What happens when AI fails?
- **Caching**: Save money and latency on repeated queries
- **Streaming**: Handle long responses progressively

**Best practices:**
- Never trust LLM output blindlyâ€”always validate
- Implement retries with exponential backoff
- Monitor API costs and usage
- Design for graceful degradation
- Keep traditional code for deterministic tasks

### 3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**What it is:** Enhancing LLM responses with relevant information from external knowledge bases.

**Critical concepts:**
- **Embeddings**: Converting text to numerical vectors for similarity search
- **Vector databases**: Store and query embeddings (Pinecone, Chroma, Qdrant, Weaviate)
- **Chunking strategies**: Breaking documents into optimal sizes
- **Retrieval methods**: Semantic search, hybrid search, reranking
- **Context injection**: Adding retrieved information to prompts

**Architecture flow:**
1. User asks a question
2. Convert question to embedding
3. Search vector DB for similar content
4. Retrieve top K most relevant chunks
5. Inject into LLM prompt as context
6. Generate response with grounded information

**Best practices:**
- Chunk size matters (500-1000 tokens often works well)
- Use metadata filtering to narrow searches
- Implement reranking for better relevance
- Keep embeddings updated when data changes
- Cite sources in responses

---

### 4. Context Management & Memory
**What it is:** Managing conversation history and state within token limits.

**Critical concepts:**
- **Token limits**: Models have max context windows (4K to 200K+ tokens)
- **Sliding windows**: Keep recent messages, drop old ones
- **Summarization**: Compress conversation history
- **Stateful vs stateless**: When to maintain memory
- **Context stuffing**: Providing all needed info in each request

**Strategies:**
- Summarize old messages to save tokens
- Extract and store key facts separately
- Use external memory (databases) for long-term recall
- Prioritize recent and important context
- Know your model's context window size

---

### 5. Evaluation & Testing
**What it is:** Validating LLM outputs when traditional unit tests aren't enough.

**Critical concepts:**
- **Eval datasets**: Golden sets of input/output pairs
- **Automated metrics**: BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, exact match
- **LLM-as-judge**: Using another LLM to evaluate outputs
- **Human evaluation**: Essential for nuanced quality
- **A/B testing**: Compare prompt variations

**Testing approaches:**
- Create regression test suites with expected outputs
- Use assertion frameworks (expect output contains X)
- Monitor outputs in production
- Track success rates and user feedback
- Version control your prompts

---

### 6. Security & Safety
**What it is:** Protecting systems and users from AI-related risks.

**Critical threats:**
- **Prompt injection**: Users manipulating AI behavior via crafted inputs
- **Data leakage**: AI revealing sensitive training data or context
- **Hallucinations**: AI generating false information confidently
- **Bias & fairness**: Perpetuating harmful stereotypes
- **Jailbreaking**: Bypassing safety guidelines

**Best practices:**
- Sanitize user inputs before sending to LLMs
- Never put secrets or credentials in prompts
- Validate AI outputs before taking actions
- Implement content filtering
- Use separate systems for sensitive operations
- Add human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
- Monitor for misuse patterns

---

### 7. Cost & Performance Optimization
**What it is:** Making LLM applications economically and technically viable.

**Cost factors:**
- Input tokens (cheaper)
- Output tokens (more expensive)
- Model size (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)
- API provider pricing

**Optimization strategies:**
- **Caching**: Save responses for repeated queries
- **Right-sizing**: Use smallest model that works
- **Batching**: Group requests when possible
- **Streaming**: Better UX without extra cost
- **Local models**: Run smaller models on your infrastructure
- **Prompt compression**: Remove unnecessary tokens
- **Early stopping**: Cut generation when you have enough

**Performance tips:**
- Parallel requests when order doesn't matter
- Use async/await patterns
- Precompute embeddings
- CDN for static content
- Monitor latency and set timeouts

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### What it is
An open protocol by Anthropic that standardizes how LLMs connect to data sources and tools.

### Core concepts
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose resources and tools
- **Resources**: Data the LLM can read (files, databases, APIs)
- **Tools**: Actions the LLM can execute (queries, API calls)
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates
- **Clients**: Applications that connect to MCP servers

### Why it matters
- **Reusability**: Write once, use across different AI apps
- **Standardization**: Common protocol vs custom integrations
- **Security**: Controlled access to resources
- **Composability**: Combine multiple MCP servers

### Getting started
1. Install the MCP SDK for your language
2. Create a simple server exposing a resource or tool
3. Connect Claude Desktop or other MCP clients
4. Expand with more complex integrations

## Local Development Setup

### Hardware recommendations
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB+ for comfort
- **Storage**: SSD with 100GB+ free space
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU optional but helpful (8GB+ VRAM)
